## üöÄ Usage

### Prerequisites

To run the emulator, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Rust**: Follow the installation instructions from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **SDL2 Library**: . On Ubuntu, you can install it by running:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
   ```

### Running the Emulator

Once the prerequisites are installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Juannbel/chip8-emulator.git
   cd chip8-emulator
   ```

2. Run the emulator with the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo run --release <path_to_rom>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_rom>` with the path to the Chip8 ROM you want to run. Sample ROMs are available in the `roms` directory within the project.
